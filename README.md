## Quick Start

Aesthetic UI is a free, open source framework that provides ready-to-use frontend components that you can easily combine to build responsive web interfaces.

Built entirely using HTML, CSS and JS, it aims at providing tools to ship code faster

To start using the components in your project, you can add the below `<link>` inside your `<head>` section of your page. Make sure to keep this as your first CSS import, if you would be using your own custom CSS classes.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://aesthetic-ui-dev.netlify.app/styles/main.css"/>
```
